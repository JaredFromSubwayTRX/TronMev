## üß∞ Understanding the MEV/Sandwich Bot

The **MEV/Sandwich Bot** is a complex trading tool designed to capitalize on Miner Extractable Value (MEV) opportunities within the TRON network. This section explains how the software operates using the provided configuration. It is highly recommended to fund your wallet with around $1000 of TRX (6500 TRX @ current time of writing)

### üîç How the MEV/Sandwich Bot Works

1. **Transaction Monitoring:**
   - The bot continuously monitors pending transactions on the TRON blockchain using the TronGrid API.
   - It identifies target transactions that are susceptible to sandwich attacks, typically those involving significant token swaps or high-value trades.

2. **Sandwich Strategy Execution:**
   - **Front-Running:** Upon detecting a target transaction, the bot places a buy order just before the target transaction is confirmed. This increases the token's price.
   - **Back-Running:** After the target transaction is processed, the bot places a sell order to capitalize on the price increase caused by its own buy order and the target transaction.

3. **Profit Extraction:**
   - The difference between the buy and sell orders constitutes the profit from the sandwich attack.
   - The bot automates this process to execute multiple profitable trades seamlessly.

![Sandwich Strategy](readmeImages/sandwich_strategy.png)

### üõ†Ô∏è Utilizing the Configurations

The bot relies on the `config.json` file to operate effectively. Here's how each configuration parameter is utilized:

| **Parameter**    | **Purpose**                                                                 | **Usage**                                                                                               |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `private_key`    | Grants the bot access to your TRX wallet for signing and sending transactions. | Used to authorize front-running and back-running transactions.                                         |
| `tron_api_key`   | Allows the bot to interact with the TRON network via TronGrid.                | Facilitates real-time monitoring of transactions and broadcasting new transactions.                     |
| `username`       | Authenticates the bot's access to licensed features and additional functionalities. | Ensures that only authorized users can deploy and operate the bot, preventing unauthorized access.       |
| `passphrase`     | Secures the authentication for the licensed features.                        | Validates the identity of the user during bot operations and access to protected functionalities.        |

### ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Overview

1. **Initialization:**
   - The bot initializes by loading configurations from `config.json`.
   - It establishes a connection with TronGrid using the provided API key.

2. **Monitoring:**
   - Continuously listens for new transactions on the network.
   - Filters transactions based on predefined criteria (e.g., token type, transaction size).

3. **Decision Making:**
   - Determines the viability of executing a sandwich attack on detected transactions.
   - Analyzes potential profitability considering gas fees and slippage.

4. **Execution:**
   - Executes front-running and back-running transactions using the private key for authorization.
   - Ensures transactions are sent promptly to maximize the chance of successful execution.

5. **Profit Handling:**
   - Collects profits from successful sandwich attacks.
   - Optionally, reinvests profits to compound gains or withdraws to the main wallet.

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- **Private Key Protection:**
  > *Ensure that your private key is stored securely and never exposed publicly. The bot uses the private key solely for transaction signing; it does not transmit the key elsewhere.*

- **API Key Security:**
  > *Protect your TronGrid API key to prevent unauthorized access. Monitor API usage to detect any unusual activity.*

- **License Credentials:**
  > *Keep your username and passphrase confidential to maintain access control. Regularly update passphrases to enhance security.*
